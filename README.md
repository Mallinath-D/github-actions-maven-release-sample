# Github action maven release - Sample project

This repository is a sample project to show you a usage of [the maven github action](https://github.com/qcastel/github-actions-maven-release) 
in a dummy Java application.


# Release your maven project using GitHub actions

We will see how you can use maven release inside a GitHub actions, to release your Java project.

Disclaimer: I am the author of the GitHub action that I will show you how to leverage today: https://github.com/qcastel/github-actions-maven-release


## Sample repository

I will use a sample repository to illustrate how this GitHub actions. The repository can be found here: https://github.com/qcastel/github-actions-maven-release-sample

The readme of this GitHub action covers all the features it offers. Here are some highlights on some of it that you may be looking for:

- Signing the commits (GPG) resulting from the maven release
- Increment the major or minor version
- Use a bot for your release

## Prepare your repository

Before you even begin setting up this github action, you would need to set up your pom.xml first to be ready for maven releases. We recommend you to refer to the maven release plugin documentation for more details: https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/

#### Configure the SCM

For our sample repository, we will use the SSH remote URL to setup the scm: 

```
<scm>
        <connection>scm:git:${project.scm.url}</connection>
        <developerConnection>scm:git:${project.scm.url}</developerConnection>
        <url>git@github.com:qcastel/github-actions-maven-release-sample.git</url>
        <tag>HEAD</tag>
</scm>
```


Next, you need to add the maven plugin:

```
<properties>
        <maven-release-plugin.version>2.5.3</maven-release-plugin.version>
</properties>
```

```
<plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-release-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${maven-release-plugin.version}</version>
        <configuration>
            <scmCommentPrefix>[ci skip]</scmCommentPrefix>
            <tagNameFormat>@{project.version}</tagNameFormat>
        </configuration>
</plugin>
```


Note: We will use the prefix [ci skip] which allows us to skip more easily any commits generated by the bot from the CI.


## Setup a basic CI as a base for our release sample

In our sample repository, we will assume we got a basic CI in place that build our Java application. 

We will start with a basic .github/workflows/release.yaml:

```
name: release version

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Build and Test
        uses: qcastel/github-actions-maven-cmd@master
        with:
          maven-args: "clean install"
```

## Setup SSH key for release

Maven release will bump the version and by doing so, will commit into the git repository. We therefore need to setup a way of authenticating to the git repository and for this sample, we choose to use SSH.

For generating a dedicating SSH key, we will use a docker container to avoid affecting your local OS. Here is a suggested way of how you can generate a SSH public and private key:

```
docker run -it qcastel/maven-release:latest  bash
```

Then run:
```
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f /tmp/sshkey -q -N ""
export SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=$(base64 /tmp/sshkey)
export SSH_PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat /tmp/sshkey.pub)
echo -n "Copy the following SSH private key and add it to your repo secrets under the name 'SSH_PRIVATE_KEY':"
echo $SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
echo "Copy the encoded SSH public key and add it as one of your repo deploy keys with write access:"
echo $SSH_PUBLIC_KEY

exit 
```

As an output, we got:

```
Copy the following SSH private key and add it to your repo secrets under the name 'SSH_PRIVATE_KEY':LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBPUEVOU1NIIFBSSVZBVEUgS0VZLS0tLS0KYjNCbGJuTnphQzFyWlhrdGRqRUFB QUFBQkc1dmJtVUFBQUFFYm05dVpRQUFBQUFBQUFBQkFBQUJGd0FBQUFkemMyZ3RjbgpOaEFBQUFB d0VBQVFBQUFRRUF2NXo3bmRmZVZ0T0czdEpHWklOZUt4OVRRdjVNdEQ2QmN4V3ZLS2p2RE9GZVhN N040Z0RBCisyRjIxQUJQY3NqSXBGNURLc0VJcDBJbE51NGhNQWFISC95TEREQVh4aTRGY05uS1hN L2pyOVViWmU4dmtINXJWYldzZ2cKN3Jib2lUMUV2YTM4UCtSOVF6eDkvcWcxRTBVZjA0UlFYTk5y WVdXRnNLcXU3bklqN2xGUGpMK1pWUnYrUkFFdzAxRlFubwplazNjZTdvalNsZVhCYURFRHhzMVVH YkR2NlZ6YStRMEpWMFRIZjlUQ2ZWSUVNaDAxdUo5NEJTQm91ZzVacjFaNVN3aEZRCjBoSFB4d0Fl OVRRZDBScE92dEpMZjlQK0NCcWtzMmRyWUxZd1hQeGZ4VHlMQ21EejZWbWVTQ1UrTUpYbTBtUmV6 Mk0xaSsKSWtkMVh1VVlaUUFBQThnb3k3RENLTXV3d2dBQUFBZHpjMmd0Y25OaEFBQUJBUUMvblB1 ZDE5NVcwNGJlMGtaa2cxNHJIMQpOQy9reTBQb0Z6RmE4b3FPOE00VjVjenMzaUFNRDdZWGJVQUU5 eXlNaWtYa01xd1FpblFpVTI3aUV3Qm9jZi9Jc01NQmZHCkxnVncyY3BjeitPdjFSdGw3eStRZm10 VnRheUNEdXR1aUpQVVM5cmZ3LzVIMURQSDMrcURVVFJSL1RoRkJjMDJ0aFpZV3cKcXE3dWNpUHVV VStNdjVsVkcvNUVBVERUVVZDZWg2VGR4N3VpTktWNWNGb01RUEd6VlFac08vcFhOcjVEUWxYUk1k LzFNSgo5VWdReUhUVzRuM2dGSUdpNkRsbXZWbmxMQ0VWRFNFYy9IQUI3MU5CM1JHazYrMGt0LzAv NElHcVN6WjJ0Z3RqQmMvRi9GClBJc0tZUFBwV1o1SUpUNHdsZWJTWkY3UFl6V0w0aVIzVmU1Umhs QUFBQUF3RUFBUUFBQVFFQW13UkptOTAwaDFJQjN1cUgKQUhJM0VQUDZ6RXduaWZxM2gzK1hnWEdL VkFWUDdnMXhDdEpKVGhYL3FHdkgycmtOZWN5NDBqSHc2ai9kRTU5N1FmdEYvbAo2MXIxcUpJVS9D SHhaVFhOcmkvVEdQUk54SXdzRkQzTWRwbEo2MVlXc2xEYStBbDE5Y3JJZkVqSU5lbW5acnVaaitt UGlrCm1RcWU4VVJXVVF1TittazNYbkFkNkZxMkVQc1NtVWZtekw2Skt1djZQZW1ScTlJWStaRUxM b0tBNU9BNGttZXdTSHNqUk4KU2FGUHpibnluRE4rUFJpdlVkQnFvWXo1RlB3OHN1cXVmSVpFODQz QTlrdU1hb2R2ak1Icm4zY2RtTXJRUWc0eEdUQlRKdgp6Zkh0RHM4YW5mbk5tVG52SVd0ZkJSelhO bnBaRFBZOTAwOTl5alBXU2NCQVVRQUFBSUFPUjlPSmo4UGpEcWg1UlIwZWNYClJMSzNFaXQwRnN3 T3EvVEdNZU5yM1hYemxpbVJWY2d2NmorQ1pjVENPcWd4KzFVUnRaOUY4TUgvcmNxN1o5VG1aL0Z0 N3QKKzRRMGxkRGFaUXZxQ3NDM3IzK2U0cVJVNUJmQmkwNnY1MU9CeW11Q1ZXV2JpNGVmZFVjSjhh c0l3Z1dad3l4bHZKSjJFeQp0VEFlblpHNmFRa3dBQUFJRUE5ZlUra2dCbHZtVVhuVk9WTjFaMEJy OStpcXF3dm5hcHRhdHRNc3VaZk1kL0RSeEUya0Z0CjZndXVqOFd0U0xqNGIvODRjMjFIcDUyc2Qv YlZBRzhpZzUxWTJoYktMdnVhTHhzTjd2Y3dWbGNpL0hIb0RWdnJhNEViU3gKbm9DaDN4MTdQRDVD SEY2WW14WHBpREZsQk9aMDdSakh2bVJKZFh0MjZrSTlma2Izc0FBQUNCQU1kdnVlOWg2M2J5TVM4 RgpHZHRoK0pCNGp5S2syVEIvL3IzdTNlT29OK05wNXRGcHpYbUNvWDZ3NkNGaEllMXhUODJjcnB4 R0dBYmtTODNVdlM4cmdWClRVNWZua3RpOENpZnBBblNISm5iWE5RMWFudUxYSWZWOWM0S0NsQjdC L3cyWG5QMGtZM1Vib1NNa1lkNlpNdUt1ZjJrR0MKdVdnNjQ3anJEMHcxWHlHZkFBQUFFWEp2YjNS QVlXTmxaV1U1TmpBd1lXVmxBUT09Ci0tLS0tRU5EIE9QRU5TU0ggUFJJVkFURSBLRVktLS0tLQo=
Copy the encoded SSH public key and add it as one of your repo deploy keys with write access:

```

We then go to our project repository, in the secret sections and add the key as follow:

We next add the SSH public key as a deploy key with write access by going to the `Deploy keys`section:

## Setup the maven release GitHub action

We are now ready to setup the maven release GitHub actions job.
We will setup the minimal setup for starting and we will then enhance it:

```
      - name: Release
        uses: qcastel/github-actions-maven-release@master
        with:
          git-release-bot-name: "bot-idhub"
          git-release-bot-email: "bot@idhub.io"

          maven-args: "-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests -DskipITs -Ddockerfile.skip -DdockerCompose.skip -Dmaven.deploy.skip=true"
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

Note: We will skip the deployment of the docker image as some of you may not have the need to containerised their Java application. We will however see how to push to docker hub in a later section.

We will also add a filter to avoid having your CI running on the commits generated by the maven release itself:

```
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[ci skip]')"

```


Once you committed this change, if everything goes well, you should see that the CI did commits for bump version change in your repository:


Congratulations! At this point you should have a functional maven release in place, which bump the version automatically.

You can stop there if that's what you were after from this maven release plugin. The other sections are optional.

### Supporting this github action

You like this GitHub actions and would like to give your support and bring it up in the GitHub market place? Add a star to this repository :) 
Surprisingly, it seems to be the only way for the github market place to highlight popular github actions. The number of uses of it in CI is not yet publicly visible and therefore not used to highlight the most popular used GitHub actions.
If you intend to use this GitHub actions, adding a star to it will help it to be more popular and therefore maintained by the GitHub community.

## Push to docker hub

How to containerise a Java application is out of scope of this article. Although as I want to show you how to push to docker hub, we will quickly containerised our sample application, using Jib:

```
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>jib-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <skip>false</skip>
        <from>
            <image>qcastel/docker-alpine-with-bash:0.3</image>
        </from>
        <to>
            <image>registry.hub.docker.com/qcastel/github-actions-maven-release-sample</image>
            <tags>
                <tag>${project.parent.version}</tag>
                <tag>latest</tag>
            </tags>
        </to>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

Then we setup the GitHub actions to access the docker hub credentials:

```
        with:
          docker-registry-id: registry.hub.docker.com
          docker-registry-username: qcastel
          docker-registry-password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
```

As you can see, it is setup to read a repository GitHub secrets. Here is how I setup the secret for the sample:

We then need to update our maven release job to not skip the docker build anymore. Our maven arguments now look like:

```
          maven-args: "-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests -DskipITs -Dmaven.deploy.skip=true"
```


Once you commit those changes, you should see that a new docker images has been pushed to docker hub!


## Setup a CI bot with GPG signature

You may be interested or have to enforce git commit signature to your repository. It's actually particular important for the CI release commits as they are the one that will ultimately produce the artefacts for your CD.
We will see how you can make the CI commits done by a CI bot, with GPG signature on top.

### Step 1: Create a bot account

There is currently no way in GitHub to create a bot without actually creating a GitHub account for it. Not much of a problem for public repositories but an issue for when you are paying got every users of your GitHub organisation. Unfortunately I don't have another solution to offer you, other than allocating one user of your organisation for the bot.

### Step 2: Find a cool avatar for your bot

Very important step, don't skip it! ;)

### Step 3: Add the SSH public key to the bot account

We added earlier our SSH public key as deploy key. This is fine if you don't intend to use a bot. In our case now, we will delete that deploy key and set the public SSH key to the bot instead.

### Step 4: Create a GPG key for the bot

You can follow the documentation of GitHub:
https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key

For this sample repository, I will try to not go too much in details on how to do it but please note that in the GitHub actions readme, we got a section dedicated for GPG that may help you: https://github.com/qcastel/github-actions-maven-release#setup-the-bot-gpg-key 


### Step 5: Invite the bot in your repository

Go to `Manage access` and add the bot in there. If you got an organisation, add him at the organisation level instead.

Accept the invitation that GitHub sent to the bot email.

### Step 6 Add the GPG key ID and private key as secrets

The CI will need to access the GPG details and it is best that they are stored as secrets:

Add the following two secrets:
- `GPG_KEY`: Copy the GPG private key (base64 encoded!)
- `GPG_KEY_ID`: Copy the GPG key ID

You can then add to the GitHub actions the following config:

```
        with:
		        gpg-enabled: true
            gpg-key-id: ${{ secrets.GPG_KEY_ID }}
            gpg-key: ${{ secrets.GPG_KEY }}
```

Once you committed those changes, you should see that the release commits are now highlighted with your bot avatar and marked as verified.
